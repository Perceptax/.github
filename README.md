# Percepta

**Perception for real hardware.**

Percepta is a vision-based observability layer for embedded systems.
It lets developers *see, assert, and diff* real-world hardware behavior using a camera, no probes, no firmware instrumentation.

If software has logs, hardware should too.

### What we build

* **observe** capture LED, display, and boot behavior
* **assert** validate expected physical states
* **diff** compare firmware versions by actual output
* local-first storage, CLI-first workflow
* foundation for hardware-aware AI development

Designed for FPGA, MCU, and embedded workflows.

### Why

Today’s AI tools can generate firmware, but they can’t verify it on real devices.

Percepta closes that loop.

We turn physical behavior into structured data so tools (and humans) can reason about hardware like software.

### Status

Alpha.
Early users. Rapid iteration.
